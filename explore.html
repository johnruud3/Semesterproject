          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science
          accessible to all. Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far
          away to the very building blocks of life itself.

            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of
            our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration
            of the world around us. We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on
            the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for
            you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum,
            there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper
            swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits
            are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn
            and explore. We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday
            between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of
            experts. During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join
            other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new
            theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us
            a message. <br />

            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning
            and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum,
            teach them in our learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will
            excite and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
            facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a visit. <br />

            universities around the country.
