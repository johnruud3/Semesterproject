              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’,
              explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
              We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit
              about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our
              solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
              exploration of the planets in our solar system. <br />
              <br /><span class="strong-text">Evolution</span> <br />
              <br />
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our
              origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his
              theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place
              in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know
              today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the
              creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
              dinosaurs too.

              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us
              unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.  For many people their life
              expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
              growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
              history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the
              discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.  Many of our great medicinal
              discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
              wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it. <br />

              <br />
              The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the
              science of the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of
              robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the
              Robot.

              <br />
              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
              important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not
              just for humans but for the whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we
              unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
              and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a
              brighter future.

              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming
              to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to
              experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering
              lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to
              create power.

            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of
            our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration
            of the world around us. We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on
            the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for
            you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
